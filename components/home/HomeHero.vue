      Based in Asheville, NC, I am a software developer with a background in
      fine art and photography. I have over seven years of experience in
      front-end development and specialize in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      TypeScript, and Vue. As part of my commitment to supporting women in
      technology, I lead a local group for female developers. My objective is to
      share my expertise and assist others in their development journeys.
