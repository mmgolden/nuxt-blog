      Iâ€™m a self-taught software developer with a fine art and photography
      background based in Asheville, NC. I have 7+ years of experience in
      front-end development and use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.
      I run a local group for women in technology. My goal is to share my
      knowledge and help other developers on their journey.
